# BestFPS

Mod which boosts you're FPS in Minecraft. It actually works.


I've looked around the darkest corners of the internet (Well, not really. Just CurseForge and GitHub) to get these mods here.
BestFPS gets you're fps from 5 to actually (Depending on you're computer) 60 or more fps.
In Vanilla Minecraft I normally tend to get around 10 or 15 FPS (Because my laptop's crap) but with these mods, well just take a look:

### I now have around 45/60 FPS, isnt that amazing? And no, it's not BetterFPS thats doing the job (Its not even included) it's ALL the mods.

# Installation

### I was too lazy to code a install so here we are.

Installation is different depending on which launcher you are using, ill add more installation methods as I learn how to get these mods working on different launchers.

Installations for:

[Normal/TLauncher](https://github.com/alexfeed1990/BestFPS/blob/main/README.md#normal-mc-launchertlauncher)

[GDLauncher](https://github.com/alexfeed1990/BestFPS/blob/main/README.md#gdlauncher)

## Normal MC launcher/TLauncher

First, download and install FabricMC from [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use), then:

Download the prefered .zip file from the [Releases](https://github.com/alexfeed1990/BestFPS/Releases) tab.
Unzip the file and extract it to the **mods** folder.

Mod folder location:

Windows: ***%appdata%\.minecraft\mods***

Linux/OS X: ***home/username/.minecraft/mods***


## GDLauncher

First, make a FabricMC instance, then:

Download the prefered .zip file from the [Releases](https://github.com/alexfeed1990/BestFPS/Releases) tab.
Unzip the file and extract it to the **mods** folder.

To get to the **mods** folder you will **right click** the FabricMC instance you just made, then click on **Go to folder**.
Then a folder window should open, go to the **mods** folder (What are you waiting form, just double click it)

# Why download the PREFERED .zip file?

There are 3 **versions** of BestFPS, the **PVP** version, the **normal version** and the **minimal** version.

The **PVP** version includes [FabricMC](https://fabricmc.net/use) PVP mods, the **normal** version doesnt include these **PVP** mods.
The **PVP** version includes a ***MiniMap*** so be careful with it on *servers* that do ***not*** allow **MiniMap mods** since you can ***easily*** get banned.

The **Minimal** version includes ***ONLY*** the FPS boosting mods.

# And of course, credit to the creators of these mods!

I just picked these mods up and got them in a ***modpack***

## I sincerely tried to get this modpack as close as I can to optifine.

No shaders, thats because of ***Sodium***.
No *Optifine* format texture packs, ***i couldnt find a mod for that***.
No **Fancy textures mode**, Sodium and other mods in this **pack** dont ***support*** that.

## That's it, thanks for a t l e a s t reading this.
