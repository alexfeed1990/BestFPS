# BestFPS

Mod which boosts you're FPS in Minecraft. It actually works.


I've looked around the darkest corners of the internet (Well, not really. Just CurseForge and GitHub) to get these mods here.
BestFPS gets you're fps from 5 to actually (Depending on you're computer) 60 or more fps.
In Vanilla Minecraft I normally tend to get around 10 or 15 FPS (Because my laptop's crap) but with these mods, well just take a look:

### I now have around 45/60 FPS, isnt that amazing? And no, it's not BetterFPS thats doing the job (Its not even included) it's ALL the mods.

# Installation

### I was too lazy to code a install so here we are.
